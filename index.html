        <p>
          Hello, my name is Kareem Itani. I am a computer science major
          attending Brooklyn College, pursuing a career in full stack web
          development. At the moment, I am a passionate Java/web developer,
          creating Java and web applications in my spare time. Additionally, I
          spend whatever time I have left during the week tutoring students in
          various school subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the weekends, I enjoy going to hackathons whenever they are
          available in order to sharpen my skills as a developer. I work with
          teams to build ambitious projects and learn new skills and teamwork
          tactics along the way.
        </p>
        <p>Fun Fact: I speak 3 languages - English, Arabic, and Spanish!</p>

            <h1>Itani.Dev</h1>
          </div>
          <p>
            This site was built with the Parcel web application bundler which 
            allowed me to further my familiarity and skills with Sass,
            vanilla CSS, and web application bundlers. As you might have
            rightfully assumed, this website's design was handcrafted to be both
            responsive and a theme of my choice. The theme was based off of a
            design I first made in the online design tool Figma and then used as a visual template when
            coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose to go with a single page application for brevity and ease of
            use. Later down the line, I may recreate this site using a framework
            to leverage the benefits of a progressive web app without manually configuring one.

          <h1>DocInsight</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          DocInsight was a passion project between me and my friends they we created during SBUHacks. The idea
          behind the web app, which was made using Bootstrap with a Node.js and Solidity backend, is
          that it will help patients share their information with doctors with the security of a  
          blockchain system.
        </p>
        <p>
          This web app would take a patient's information and store it in such a
          fashion such that any personal patient (i.e. name, birthday, etc.) information that is not strictly
          medically relevant can only be seen be a patient-approved doctor otherwise other doctors are allowed to see the anonymise mdeical information. This
          can be helpful for research purposes, enabling doctors to see a wide
          variety of information in order to seek out patterns behind medical
          problems without breaching privacy boundaries.
